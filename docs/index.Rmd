# **1. Table of Contents**
|
| This document presents a non-exhaustive list of oversampling and undersampling algorithms applied for severe class imbalance using various helpful packages in <mark style="background-color: #CCECFF">**R**</mark>.
|
| Oversampling and undersampling algorithms address imbalanced classification problems by changing the data set used for model training through non-random resampling to achieve a more reasonably balanced data between the majority and minority classes. In oversampling, new instances are created from the minor class instead of merely creating copies, by selecting two or more similar instances (using a distance measure) and perturbing an instance one attribute at a time by a random amount within the difference to the neighboring instances. In undersampling, The algorithms applied in this study (mostly contained in the <mark style="background-color: #CCECFF">**caret**</mark>, <mark style="background-color: #CCECFF">**themis**</mark> and <mark style="background-color: #CCECFF">**ROSE**</mark> packages attempt to augment imbalanced data prior to model training by updating the original data set to minimize the effect of the disproportionate ratio of instances in each class.
